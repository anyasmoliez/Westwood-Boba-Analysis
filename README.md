# Westwood-Boba-Analysis

In this project, I set out to find the contributing factors of a successful boba store in the Los Angeles area, specifically the area near Westwood (the home of UCLA's campus).
Using the Yelp API, I extracted data from 1000 boba stores as well their corresponding reviews. From there, I manipulated the data and cleaned it up so that I could
further explore the datasets. The work done to compile this dataset can be found in the yelpscraper-Copy1.ipynb file.

After reading in the dataset, I explored and analyzed the data with data visualizations. Afterwords, I used natural language processing tools in order to perform sentiment
analysis on the reviews.

Results and analyses can be found in the Westwood Boba Analysis-Final.ipynb file.
